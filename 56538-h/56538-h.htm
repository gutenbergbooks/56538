<div class="verse">He was a widower, having no wife,</div>
<div class="verse">True! he was old, being now eighty-three,</div>

<div class="verse">For the color&#8217;d porter at window stood,</div>
<div class="verse">With a shining face, in a laughing mood,</div>
<div class="verse">And to the question, &#8220;Is Mr. Brown at home?&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Would reply, &#8220;Mr. and Misses are gone</div>
<div class="verse">On a southern tour;&#8221; then, with twinkling eye,</div>
<div class="verse">Would smilingly add, &#8220;They&#8217;ll be home by and by.&#8221;</div>

<div class="verse">But the <i>Writ</i> was served by an authorized mode&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Not &#8220;personal,&#8221; but as prescribed by the &#8220;Code;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Commissioners appointed, one, two and three,</div>
<div class="verse">In matters <i>ex-parte</i> must surely agree.</div>
<div class="verse">But now he displayed both wisdom and pluck,</div>
<div class="verse">His head was all right, and so was his luck;</div>
<div class="verse">Sir Thomas appeared in a legalized way,</div>
<div class="verse">By Counsel appeared, and presented a &#8220;<i>Stay</i>,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">An &#8220;<i>Order of Court</i>,&#8221; which all must abide,</div>
<div class="verse">The first step to set all proceedings aside.</div>
<div class="verse">He said to his lawyer, a man of renown,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I&#8217;ll show them I&#8217;m neither a fool or a clown.</div>
<div class="verse">They swore I was crazy, and out of my mind,</div>
<div class="verse">An old dotard they called me&mdash;lame, halt, and blind;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
<div class="verse">They shall take it all back! a stroke of my pen</div>
<div class="verse">Shall force them to cry out Amen! and Amen!</div>
<div class="verse">Having conquered thus far, possessing my wife,</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ll heal up old sores&mdash;prevent further strife;</div>
<div class="verse">Matters now doubtful, shall by law be made plain,</div>
<div class="verse">My children no longer shall curse, or complain.</div>
<div class="verse">So sit down at once&mdash;do all in your power,</div>
<div class="verse">To have this my &#8216;<i>Last Will</i>&#8217; complete in an hour;</div>
<div class="verse">The words I will dictate to you, my dear friend,</div>
<div class="verse">Your wisdom and judgment, I trust, will commend.&#8221;</div>
